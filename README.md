# COMP 487 - Deep Learning Class


Welcome to the repository for the **Deep Learning Class** offered in Spring 25! This repository is designed to serve as a comprehensive resource for students enrolled in the course, providing code, demos, and examples to help you understand and implement key concepts in deep learning.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into several folders, each containing specific types of resources:

### 1. **Notebooks**
   - **Location:** `notebooks/`
   - **Description:** This folder contains Jupyter notebooks that illustrate various deep learning architectures and concepts. Each notebook is designed to walk you through the implementation of different models, from basic to advanced, with explanations and visualizations to aid your understanding.
   - **Examples:** 
     - Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP)
     - Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
     - Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)
     - Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)
     - Transformers and Attention Mechanisms

### 2. **Python Model Designs**
   - **Location:** `models/`
   - **Description:** This folder contains Python scripts and modules that implement various deep learning models. These scripts are structured to be modular, allowing you to easily experiment with different architectures and hyperparameters.
   - **Examples:**
     - Custom implementations of CNNs, RNNs, and GANs
     - Pre-trained models and transfer learning examples
     - Model training and evaluation scripts

### 3. **Datasets**
   - **Location:** `datasets/`
   - **Description:** This folder contains links to datasets used in the course, as well as scripts for downloading and preprocessing data. Proper data handling is crucial in deep learning, and this section will help you get started with the right datasets for your projects.
   - **Examples:**
     - MNIST, CIFAR-10, and ImageNet datasets
     - Text and sequence data for NLP tasks
     - Custom dataset loading and preprocessing scripts

### 4. **Utilities**
   - **Location:** `utils/`
   - **Description:** This folder contains utility scripts and helper functions that are used across different notebooks and models. These utilities are designed to simplify common tasks such as data augmentation, visualization, and model evaluation.
   - **Examples:**
     - Data augmentation functions
     - Visualization tools for training curves and model predictions
     - Helper functions for model saving and loading
